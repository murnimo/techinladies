            Hi team! I am curious about all things art, travel, tech, and startups, I am part corporate and part creative. I am a certified Scrum Master, a Marcomm professional, and a Creative with a growth mindset.
        </p>
        <p>I have been following TechLadies since its birth in 2016 but was too intimidated to join or attend any of the events. My first tech event was with "The Codette Project - Tech for Good Hackathon" in July 2018. Our team won the Best Creative Use of Data. :) </p>
        <p>I would like to be a part of the 2021 Techladies Bootcamp to be a full stack developer, in hopes to create solutions that matter. I hope you will make my dream come true!</p>
